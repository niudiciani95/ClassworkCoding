The final project that brings in all of the skills and knowledge of previous classes to collaborate and create an entire system. We had the choice of which types of coding language to use, and at first we had proposed a blend of Java and SQL, but later decided on an SQL switchboard application.

This project osught to create an digital system to replace a security company's primitive system of event tracking and human resources allocation.
Previous system was achieved through mere notebooks and handwriting, with primitive measures of storage using filing cabinets.
Ultimate goal was to prove this system can be modernized for ease of access and use.

Some other assignments are included to showcase steps leading up to the project itself, such as critical path analysis, network diagrams, Gantt charts, economic feasibility analyses.
