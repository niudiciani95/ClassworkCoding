# ClassworkCoding
This is a repository for my work as a student in university. it includes java programs, SQL queries and databases, along with other coding related work. This is to create a portfolio for myself to showcase my skills and knowledge and hopefully gain a career working in the IT industry.
Some of the files include names of my classmates whom I worked with in order to complete various projects.
